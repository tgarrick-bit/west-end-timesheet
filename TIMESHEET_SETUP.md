# Timesheet Entry System Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the timesheet entry system for your West End Workforce app.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Database Setup

1. **Open your Supabase project dashboard**
2. **Go to the SQL Editor**
3. **Copy and paste the contents of `setup-timesheet-tables.sql`**
4. **Run the script**

This will create all necessary tables, indexes, and sample data.

### 2. Environment Variables

Ensure your `.env.local` file has the correct Supabase credentials:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### 3. Test the System

1. **Start your development server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Navigate to `/timesheet/entry`** (employees only)
3. **Use the demo account**: `employee@westendworkforce.com` / `employee123`
